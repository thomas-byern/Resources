# 📑 Articles Companion Repository

**Templates, code samples, and supplementary materials for my published articles.**

---

## Welcome

This repository is the companion home for resources that accompany my writing. When an article references a template, configuration file, code snippet, or downloadable asset—you'll find it here.

Topics vary widely: software architecture, self-hosting, engineering practices, tooling, and whatever else I find worth exploring. Each folder maps to a specific article or topic area, making it easy to find exactly what you're looking for.

## Repository Structure

Resources are organized by topic or article. Browse the folders below, or check the index for direct links.

```
├── topic-name/
│   ├── README.md          # Overview and context
│   ├── templates/         # Ready-to-use templates
│   ├── examples/          # Filled-out examples
│   └── assets/            # Diagrams, printables, configs
└── ...
```

> **Naming convention:** Folder names match article topics or slugs for easy cross-referencing.

## What You'll Find Here

Depending on the article, resources might include:

- **Templates** — Markdown, YAML, and config files ready to use
- **Code Samples** — Scripts, snippets, and working examples
- **Printables** — PDF-friendly checklists and reference cards
- **Diagrams** — Architecture visuals, flowcharts, and schemas
- **Configurations** — Docker Compose files, dotfiles, and tool configs

Each resource is meant to save you time—not prescribe a single "right way."

## About the Articles

I write about software engineering, architecture, self-hosting, developer tooling, and the occasional deep-dive into whatever rabbit hole I've fallen into.
